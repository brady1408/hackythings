# Don't Buy Dell's extended warranty

![Does anyone else notice the site I’m on? It doesn’t say XPS… But I was hung up on anyway](https://www.bradycole.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Dell-support-hangup-1568x1015.png)

## TLDR;

I purchased a top of the line Alienware 17 R1 and thought I would invest in a 5-year warranty including accidental damage from dell at the time of purchase. (Yes I also purchased a warranty on my new car, no I would not recommend anyone do the same in the future) I used this warranty in Sep of 2016 because of a failing GPU, and after the laptop was returned to me covered in scratches and missing it’s SSD Dell agreed to replace the laptop with a refurbished Alienware 17 R3. I then opened a ticket with Dell Tech Support a couple of years later due to an issue with the ‘Q’ key on my Alienware’s keyboard going out only to find that my laptop had been flagged in Dell’s financial system as stolen. This ticket was originally opened on Nov 22, 2018, and in January of the next year I ended up purchasing a replacement keyboard myself off of eBay ($78) and installing it. I then reopened a ticket after the Alienware started to randomly power off in July of 2019 and am only now (Oct 23rd, 2019) getting a technician sent to me to replace the motherboard.

## About me

Let me start out with an introduction. My name is Brady and I’ve owned an AW for quite some time, I do like the laptops but I HATE dells support. In fact, I’ve had such an unpleasant experience that I want to share it here, but first a little more about me. I’m a Software engineer but I’ve done many jobs over my life. I’ve Been an IT Tech, I’ve been a member of an on-premise operations team specializing in network, OS, and Hardware. I’ve been a Database Administrator, and I’ve been a Software Engineer. Currently, I’m a Sr Software Engineer. I’m not trying to feed you my resume but I want people to understand I’m VERY technically inclined, and have experience with enough aspects of a machine to know what is wrong and how to fix it. But even with this experience, working with Dell has been a nightmare. I honestly don’t know what people do that don’t have this kind of experience in their past to draw on when trying to get help with an issue. So with the introductions out of the way lets get to the experience I would like to share with Dell support.

## Back Story

I have an Alienware laptop that I purchased a few years ago. This machine had a few issues with artifacts in the graphics that couldn’t be resolved. They sent an individual to my house a couple of times, he replaced the GPU, RAM, and Motherboard, but after the second time, they said it would be faster if I sent in the laptop to a service center. This was a little frustrating as I had paid for a 2-day service plan, but I understand that things happen and I agreed to send it in. I sent it in on the 7th of the month and did not get it back until the 25th. I mention this only because I’m about to include the email that I sent to dell when I got the laptop back, and the date offers a little bit of missing context.

### Sep 7th, 2016 – From Me

The reply was several emails back and forth and essentially came back with an apology and offer to replace the system with a refurbished R3 as this was an R1 that sounded amazing and it was, the new model lacked the 240Hz display and Blu-ray but had a nicer CPU and GPU and more importantly lacked all the scratches from the repair center. Honestly, I could have lived with everything but those deep chunks missing from the touchpad. It is worth noting that I opened the ticket on 8/7 and received the replacement on 9/25 this was quite a while to be without a machine especially when paying for the Alienware Premium Support plan.

## Fast forward

Now fast forward to about a year ago. Where the keyboard’s Q key stopped working. Now I invested in the 5-year warranty, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect support on a machine after an amount of time if you invested with the companies internal warranty if they can’t support it why offer the warranty. So still having a warranty I called Alienware for support with this issue. This is where my NIGHTMARE began.

### Nov 22nd, 2018 – Opened a ticket

I opened a ticket but was told that there was a financial hold on my laptop and that they would have to work with that team to remove the hold. This didn’t make any sense because I paid cash for my Alienware and my warranty. At this time I sent support every email and receipt that I have on record which is everything (Thank you Gmail and Google Drive!).

Here is the correspondence I have in email, it’s worth noting that there are HOURS on the phone that are not documented here.

### Nov 29th, 2018

At this point, I canceled a new Alienware 15 R5 order as this warranty issue had me really bothered. I had planned to upgrade this machine at this point so it was the purchase was unrelated though not having a working keyboard kind of cripples the portability of a laptop, I’m rocking an external keyboard everywhere I go. I opted to go with a Gigabyte Aero 15 v8 instead of a dell as dell’s warranty is really their selling point and it’s failing me.

### Dec 5th, 2018

Now I’m feeling super frustrated, I feel I have no recourse no one to reach out to and nothing that I can do. So I reach out to the social media arm of dell, maybe these guys know a way to help me get ahold of someone that can actually help me. I send them the following email.

And yes I’m obviously steaming at this point

### Dec 12th, 2018

It’s been another two weeks now and I’ve heard nothing, I called dell for an update and got nowhere. I asked for Managers, someone higher up at dell, someone in the US as I’m tired of call centers sending me in circles and literally hanging up on me. These phone calls take me HOURS!

### Dec 13th, 2018 – Dell

### Dec 20th, 2018

I was contacted by a fake dell support scam trying to get me to install a utility on my computer because my computer was “reporting back to dell that it has a virus”. I know this is BS and it happens quite often after I open a ticket with dell support. I have called and opened an unrelated ticket with the fraud department concerning a fake agent contacting me on behalf of dell support.

### Dec 20th, 2018 – Me

**What? Are you kidding me!?!** I had made myself available all day to get this resolved and had been watching my phone like a hawk. I had no missed calls for the entire day and no voice mail which would indicate the call may not have gone through.

At this point, I went to eBay tired of having a computer that will not work, and order a replacement keyboard. [https://www.ebay.com/itm/372189057384](https://www.ebay.com/itm/372189057384). So now I have paid hundreds of $$$ for an expensive warranty from Dell and $70 for a new keyboard. Thanks, Dell!!!

Also, I receive no further contact from Dell on this issue period.

## Fast forward some more

Fast forward to July, I’m using my Alienware but it’s now randomly powering off. This is obviously an issue, I’m **COMPLETELY** dreading calling Dell tech support for what I hope by now are obvious reasons. But having a computer that is not working when I paid for a warranty is not an option in my opinion so I suck it up, suppress my anxiety and dial the number for Dell tech support. As expected this call takes hours and I get routed through what I think must be every department at dell before I finally land at a Tech support agent in the financial department. Up to this point, I have been careful not to give out dell employee names because I’m trying to expose what I feel is an issue with Dell and not their employees. However, this individual actually stuck with the issue until it was resolved and followed up with me as promised every time they committed to. Because I think they deserve recognition for a job well done I will share with you this individual in their communications.

### Jul 29th, 2019 – Dell

> Hello Brady,
>
> thank you for your time today, Once you clear the hold let me know and
> I will be happy to help you with your system.
>
> Daniela Technical Support Agent.

Daniela communicated with me over the phone so I don’t have transcripts but she took charge of the situation, called me once a week with updates and finally got my account issues resolved. It still took Dell over a month after I contacted them to do so.

## So what happened

It turns out that back when I had my original machine replaced that dell never switched the owner in their system, and because it was originally purchased by an individual through Dell Financial, when they stopped getting payments on it (probably due to the fact that it was returned) they put a hold on the service tag and no other department could do anything with the system until this hold was removed. I had clear documentation that I paid cash for my original machine, and that the service tag was sent to me as a replacement for this original system. I send all this information to Dell several times. Daniela opened a ticket with their support department, apparently dell financial has a support department but you can not access them as a customer. And after a month of her following up and providing them with more information, the system was finally unlocked and the ownership was transferred to my account.

## What happened next

A few days after the machine has been resolved in Dell’s system I call for support. I’m told that my machine doesn’t have a warranty. I have receipts showing that it does, but I’m completely burnt out on dell support once again.

### Oct 8th, 2019

At this point, my laptop will no longer even power on. They literally hang up on me if they don’t want to deal with the issue. I even got hung up on during a chat session which I didn’t think was possible.

I call Dell support get transferred to another department again where I have to leave a voice message and hope they get back to me. I do so with very little expectations for any follow up from dell.

## Oct 23rd, 2019 (today)

I don’t know what has changed (maybe a VM I left but never heard from Dell on?) but apparently now I do have a warranty and dell has scheduled a tech to come replace my motherboard.

## Summary and the ask

At this point, I’m in the market for a new machine and the new AW M15 has incredible reviews on its keyboard, as a software engineer, this is probably the most important aspect of a laptop for me. Unfortunately, I have been unhappy with my Gigabytes keyboard for some time. I don’t like that it is offset for the 10 key and I don’t like the force required to press the keys and that if I press a key with my pinky they usually don’t even register and I skip letters all over the place. Thank you for compilers and spell checks but it’s still an annoyance.

I don’t know if I can bring myself to ever work with Dell again. What do you guys think? I’d appreciate any comments people would like to leave on this subject.
